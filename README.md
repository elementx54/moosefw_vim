INTRODUCTION
------------
To help make writing MOOSE input files easier on a common editor found on
almost all remote computation resources, I want to make VIM files that do the
style right, highlight keywords, do folding, and might check for open blocks
or unmatched open-close pairs.

INSTALLING
----------
Inside the users home VIM directory (on Linux ".vim") copy the contents of each
subdirectory into the corresponding subdirectory. If a subdirectory does not
exist then create that subdirectory.

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
Feel free to change highlighting colors in the syntax/moose_fw.vim file.
Actually, feel free to change anything. This is pretty simple.
